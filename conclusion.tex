High performance computing systems are growing toward hundreds of thousands to million node machines, utilizing the computing power of billions of cores. Running parallel applications on such large machines efficiently will require optimized runtime environments that are scalable and resilient. Multi and many core chip architectures in large scale supercomputers pose several new challenges to designers of operating systems and runtime environments.

HPX-RTE is a new, light weight, and open source runtime system specifically designed for the emerging exascale computing environment. The system is designed relying on HPX project advanced features to allow for easy extension and transparent scalability. HPX-RTE provides full compatibility for current MPI applications to run on HPX runtime system. HPX-RTE provides an easy and simple path for transition from MPI to HPX. It also paves the way for future hybrid programming models such as HPX-MPI and integration of more features from HPX into Open MPI.
