The Open Run-Time Environment (ORTE)~\cite{Castain2008153} was developed as part of Open MPI~\cite{gabriel04:_open_mpi} project to support distributed high-performance computing applications operating in a heterogeneous environment. Its main characteristics are interprocess communication, resource discovery and allocation, and process launch across different platforms in a transparet manner. Implementation of the ORTE is based on the Modular Component Architecture (MCA)~\cite{gabriel04:_open_mpi}.
