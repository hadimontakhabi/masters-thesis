The Open Run-Time Environment (ORTE)~\cite{Castain2008153} was developed as part of Open MPI
~\cite{gabriel04:_open_mpi} project to support distributed high-performance computing
applications operating in a heterogeneous environment. Its main 
characteristics are interprocess communication, resource discovery and
allocation, and process launch across different platforms in a transparet manner.
Implementation of the ORTE is based on the Modular Component Architecture 
(MCA)~\cite{gabriel04:_open_mpi}.
